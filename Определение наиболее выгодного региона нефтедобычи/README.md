# Project Description

You have been provided with oil samples in three regions. The characteristics for each well in the region are already known. Build a model to determine the region where mining will bring the greatest profit. Analyze the possible profits and risks with the Bootstrap technique.


# The purpose of the study

Build a machine learning model that will help determine the region where mining will bring the greatest profit. Analyze the possible profits and risks with the Bootstrap technique.


# Data description 

- id — unique well ID;
- f0, f1, f2 — three signs of dots (it doesn't matter what they mean, but the signs themselves are significant);
- product — the volume of reserves in the well (thousand barrels).

# General conclusion

The distribution of profits for each region, the risk of losses and the average profit are found. According to these characteristics, the region for the development of wells was selected.
Non-unique wells were found in the data, as well as a correlation of the f2 trait in one of the regions. This requires clarification to increase the accuracy of the study.
Testing of other regression models showed different results.
